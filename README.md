2.  > LiftsySignUp - contains the old `index.html` files. Added `Index2.html` 
     *  When running `Index.html` and pressing > "Sign Up" buttons points to `index2.html` that contains the body for a user to create a username and password. 
     * Getting stuck after that. Can't get the `DAO` file to work and talk to the databasae. 
     * Additionally created `Signup.html` in this package. The code uses google firebase template code for sign-up/sign in page.
